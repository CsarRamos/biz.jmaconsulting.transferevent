Participant Event Transfer
=================================

This extension to CiviCRM allows transferring a participant registered for an event to a different event. This is not to be confused with the existing self service functionality in core, where you can transfer your registration for a single event to a different participant, for that same event.

Installation
------------

1. As part of your general CiviCRM installation, you should set a CiviCRM Extensions Directory at Administer >> System Settings >> Directories.
2. As part of your general CiviCRM installation, you should set an Extension Resource URL at Administer >> System Settings >> Resource URLs.
3. Navigate to Administer >> System Settings >> Manage Extensions.
4. Beside Event Transfer click Install.

General Usage
---------------------

1. You can transfer a single participant to a different event by clicking on the "Transfer Event" menu item next to the participant record when searched for using the Find participants screen or on the Events tab in the contact summary page.
2. Alternatively, you can use the actions dropdown menu when you find participants, to select multiple participants to transfer them to a single event.
